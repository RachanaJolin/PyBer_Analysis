# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization
#Write a summary in your README.md file for the data in the summary DataFrame.
  Urban area had the highest rides- which makes sense since people in bigger cities are more prone to using "Pyber", they don't want to look for parking and such.. As a result the largest number of drivers are in the urban areas and the highest fares are generated in the urban areas as well. Average fare/ride and Average/Driver is the lowest in the urban area though- which also makese sense- the ride is most likely shorter in the urban area compared to in rural area. Average Fare/ride and driver is the higest in the Rural area- distance is the major factor
  Write a summary in your README.md file on what the multiple line graph tells you about the fares for each city type over time.
  Urban : The fares fluctuate between 2000-2500 over time, ocassionally it crosses the 2500 mark but only twice in my plot. 
  Suburban : The fares fluctuate between 900-1400. So within a 500$ window again
  Rural : Fares fluctuate between a 500$ window in the rural area as well. 
  
    Business seems consistent in all 3 area. 
    
    Errors in my Solution : I believe there's an issue in the order in which I wrote the solutions- which is my why plot started from $0 Fare. My code appears to be "right" , but I think there's an issue in the order I wrote it, perhaps.
